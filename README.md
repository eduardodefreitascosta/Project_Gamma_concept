# This is a paper describying the growth and inactivarion of *Salmonella* spp. in salami in Brazilian industrial conditions .

## The paper is available online: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352352221000190




## Instrucitons to reproduce the results from the paper "Application of a predictive microbiological model for estimation of *Salmonella* behavior throughout the manufacturing process of salami in environmental conditions of small-scale Brazilian manufacturers".



## IMPORTANT (This model depends on the Bayesian inference for the *Salmonella* sp. concentration)
